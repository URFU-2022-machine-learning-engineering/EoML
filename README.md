# Final Project for "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence"
## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is the final project for the course "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence". The project encompasses various aspects of AI ethics, focusing on practical implementation and ethical considerations in AI models.

## Contents

- Importing Data: The initial section of the project, where necessary data is imported for processing and analysis.

- Assignment 1: Data Segmentation
        Data Splitting: This part covers the segmentation of data into training and testing sets, a crucial step for model validation.

- Assignment 2: Data Vectorization
        Vectorizing Data: Involves transforming the data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

- Assignment 3: Model Definition and Training
        Defining and Training the Model: This section discusses the selection of an appropriate model for the task and its subsequent training.

- Assignment 4: Predicting Comment Toxicity
        Toxicity Prediction Function: Here, a function is developed to predict the toxicity of comments, demonstrating the application of AI in monitoring online interactions.

## Objectives

- To apply AI techniques in addressing ethical issues.
- To demonstrate the ability to preprocess, vectorize, and train a model on a given dataset.
- To develop a practical solution for detecting and addressing toxic comments in digital platforms.
